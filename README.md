# About me
This is a quick React.js project I built to revise my skills and experience with key hooks (e.g., useEffect, useState) and practise my understanding of components. I hope you enjoy my project and use it to keep track of daily to-dos to help you carry out more productive days :)

## Future improvements:
1. Expanding the maximum length of inputs so you can enter a to-do input which can be as long as you need it to be
2. Adjusting the view to fit user requirements
